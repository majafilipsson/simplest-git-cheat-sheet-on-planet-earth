### Description
This is the simplest git cheat sheet ever, for absolute beginners. You're welcome, fellow newbie.

### Basic commands for your terminal

- `cd`: Navigate to the correct folder on your computer using cd.
- `cd ..` : Navigate 'backwards' using cd ..
- `ls`: List contents of a directory by using ls.
- `cat`: Print ocu content of textfile.
- `pwd`: Prints current directory path.
- `tab`, baby: Because our memory is bad, we use ls. After ls reminds us of the name of the folder we are searching for, we want    to cd into that folder. Because we are lazy, we write the first letter of that directory, then we tab. Yes, make tab your friend today. Your keyboard will thank you.
- `mkdir`: Create new directory.
- `touch`: Create new file.
- `rm`: Remove file (-r to remove directories)
- `mv`: Move or rename file or folder. Needs source and target. Example:
      mv directory-being-moved destination/directory-being-moved/
- `open`: Opens specified directory (EX. open index.html OR open . to open current directory)
- `code`: Open up choosen file in VS Code.
- `atom`: Open up choosen file in Atom.
- `cp`: Copies a file or directory.


### How to git in terminal

- `git pull`: **ALWAYS** do a git pull before you start your work for the day to make sure you are up to date with latest github changes (this way you won't have to memorize the git merge command 😉 )

- `git clone`: Use git clone + url to clone a repository to your computer
- `git status`: Check the status of a git repository on your computer using git status. This will tell you if there are uncommitted changes on your computer.
- `git diff`: Let's you compare your changes to the last commit (very useful if you're working on those commit messages being meaningful 😉 )
- `git add`: Add changes for commit using git add and preferably a . for simplicity (. means all changes will be included in the adding)
- `git status`: Use git status again because it makes your anxious newbie brain feel safe upon seeing your changes staged for commit in wonderful, good-to-go green.
- `git commit`: Commit changes. Remember to add a message, which should look like this: git commit -m "message goes here"
- `git push`: Push your changes and voilà, you're all done.
